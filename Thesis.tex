Precision farming is a farming concept aimed at improving the yield of a farm by observing, measuring and analysing the crops. This aims at utilizing the latest development in the fields of UAVs, image processing, cloud and machine learning to deliver data driven plating advice. High yield of each crop is dependent on the seed, the soil, the cropping pattern, the weather, water and the use of fertilizer and the lack of pets. Considering all these parameters, hyperspectral imaging of thee crops taken by the drone helps to predict what is growing healthy and what not.

The project includes designing an autonomous Hex-copter with a Go-pro HD camera mounted using the gimbal for collecting the data of hyperspectral images. The processing of this hyperspectral image data is performed on the server by utilizing various open-source computer vision and GIS libraries. This pre-processed data is classified with the help of vegetation indices combined with machine learning algorithms. Once the critical areas of the farm are known from the above approach, a deep learning model is used to analyse the images of the crops in those critical areas to provide a prescription of the disease on a simple to use Graphical User Interface (GUI).
